Getting started with React. Creating a movies catalog using The Movie DB API. Thanks to [CodeCamps](https://www.codecamps.com/) for this fantastic [course](https://sweetpumpkins.codecamps.com/).  

After finishing the course I was able to add another search criteria to the navigation component using the [MovieDb Search API}(https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies)  

![search movie by title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fahani/the-movie-db-api/master/public/Search-by-title.png "Search Movie by Title")  

To use this project you just have to create a [react app](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html) and then overwrite the directories src and public. Also copy the .env file.
